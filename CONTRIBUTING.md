# Contributing

Contributions, feedback, and discussions are all welcome.

If you'd like to request a feature or report a bug, open an issue first and wait for a response before starting work on a pull request. This keeps effort focused and avoids surprises for both sides.

Once your PR is approved and merged, your changes will ship with the next release.

Please keep all interactions respectful and constructive.
